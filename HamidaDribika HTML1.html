<h2>What could possibly go wrong ... 
    Experts reveal the dangers of Elon Musk's radical Neuralink brain interface</h2>


<blockquote>Neuralink – which is 'developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers'
     – is probably a bad idea. If you understand the science behind it, and that's what you wanted to hear, you can stop reading.
      But this is an absurdly simple narrative to spin about Neuralink and an unhelpful attitude to have 
      when it comes to understanding the role of technology in the world around us, and what we might do about it. </blockquote>

<br>
<p>Neuralink is developing a 'whole brain interface', essentially a network of tiny electrodes linked to your brain that the company envisions will allow us to communicate wirelessly with the world. 

    It would enable us to share our thoughts, fears, hopes and anxieties without demeaning ourselves with written or spoken language.
    One consequence of this is that it would allow us to be connected at the biological level to the internet. 
    <strong>But it's who would be connecting back with us, how, where, why and when that are the real questions.</strong>

<h3>Merging with AI</h3>

<p>The device the firm has developed consists of a tiny probe containing more than 3,000 electrodes attached to flexible threads - thinner than a human hair - which can then monitor the activity of 1,000 neurons.
    The advantage of this system, according to the firm, is that it would be able to target very specific areas of the brain, which would make it surgically safer. 
    It would also be able to analyse recordings using machine learning, which would then work out what type of stimulation to give a patient.
    NeuraLink did not explain how the system translated brain activity or how the device was able to stimulate brain cells.
    <q>It's not like suddenly we will have this incredible neural lace and will take over people's brains,</q> Mr Musk said during his presentation. <q>It will take a long time.</q>
    But he said, <em>for those who choose it</em>, the system would ultimately allow for <q>symbiosis with artificial intelligence</q>.

<h4>Electrodes read and write brain data</h4>

<p>Neuralink is designing its electrodes not just to "read" from neurons what's going on in the brain, but also to "write" signals into the brain, said Neuralink scientist Philip Sabes.
    "Even in a benign AI scenario, we will be left behind.
     Hopefully it is a benign scenario," in which <b> superintelligent AIs surpass but don't wipe out humans</b>, Musk said.
      "With a high-bandwidth brain-machine interface,
     I think we can go along for the ride and effectively have the option of merging with AI."
